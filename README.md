### Design Patterns
A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a common problem that occurs in software design.Design patters are not specific to a particular programming language or technology; instead, they are abstract templates that can be applied to various software development scenarios.

We can divide them into three categories:
1. Creational patterns: These patters deal with object creation mechanism, trying to to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include the singleton, factory, abstract factory, builder. 
2. Structural patterns: These patterns focus on the composition of classes or objects to form larger structures. Examples include the adapter, decorator, facade, composite.
3. Behavioral patterns: These patterns define how objects interact and communicate with each other. Examples include mediator, observer, command.
